# Welcome to the BIR!

We are a team of scientists dedicated to Bioinformatics Research (BIR) in the context of public health issues. We [develop and use computational methods](tools) for the analysis of sequencing data, for the identification of pathogens such as viruses and bacteria from various sources, and for molecular surveillance of infectious diseases. As part of the department [Methodology and Research Infrastructure, Bioinformatics](https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/MF/MF1/mf1_node.html;jsessionid=1C82A7A82428E5F11AD1D823B18081B7.internet052) of the [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html) in Berlin our questions revolve around research topics such as:

[![](/index/hybrid.svg){style="width:320px" align="right"}](https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.15186)

* Microbial bioinformatics
* _de novo_ assembly & annotation
* Transcriptomics & comparative genomics
* Metagenomics & -transcriptomics
* Real-time nanopore sequencing
* Workflow management & reproducibility
* Automation & visualization

We strive to combine well-established and novel computational approaches in reproducible workflows to transform data into knowledge about microbial *omics and improve health with our methods.

<!--
We develop novel tools and workflows for handling large amounts of sequence data. We apply computational methods to automate de novo (meta-)genome and transcriptome assembly, analysis and annotation of RNA-Seq data, identification and characterization of pathogens such as viruses and bacteria from environmental samples and (more recently) molecular monitoring of infectious diseases.
