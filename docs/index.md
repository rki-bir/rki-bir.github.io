# Welcome to the Bioinformatics Research Team!

We are the BIR, a team of scientists dedicated to bioinformatics research in the context of public health issues. We [develop and use computational methods](tools) for the analysis of sequencing data, for the identification of pathogens such as viruses and bacteria from various sources, and for molecular surveillance of infectious diseases. As part of the department [Methodology and Research Infrastructure, MF1 Bioinformatics](https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/MF/MF1/mf1_node.html;jsessionid=1C82A7A82428E5F11AD1D823B18081B7.internet052) of the [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html) in Berlin our questions revolve around research topics such as:

* Microbial bioinformatics
* _de novo_ assembly & annotation
* Transcriptomics & comparative genomics
* Metagenomics & -transcriptomics
* Real-time nanopore sequencing
* Workflow management & reproducibility
* Automation & visualization


<!--
We develop novel tools and workflows for handling large amounts of sequence data. We apply computational methods to automate de novo (meta-)genome and transcriptome assembly, analysis and annotation of RNA-Seq data, identification and characterization of pathogens such as viruses and bacteria from environmental samples and (more recently) molecular monitoring of infectious diseases.

We strive to combine well-established and novel computational approaches into reproducible workflows to analyze and visualize large amounts of short- and long-read sequencing data.
